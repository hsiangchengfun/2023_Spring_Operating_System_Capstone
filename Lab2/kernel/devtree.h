/*
Structure Block
The structure block describes the structure and contents of the devicetree itself. 
It is composed of a sequence of tokens with data
These are organized into a linear tree structure


The structure block is composed of a sequence of pieces, 
each beginning with a token, that is, a big-endian 32-bit integer. 
Some tokens are followed by extra data, the format of which is determined by the token value. 
All tokens shall be aligned on a 32-bit boundary, 
which may require padding bytes (with a value of 0x0) to be inserted after the previous tokenâ€™s data.

*/

/*
String BLock
The strings block contains strings representing 
all the property names used in the tree
